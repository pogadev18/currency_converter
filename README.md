# Currency Converter with React.js
### This project, unfortunately, I couldn't host it live somewhere, because the free API key that I'm using for the currencies doesn't allow me to make requests :frowning_face:, but you can definitely clone this repo and have fun with the code. :money_mouth_face:

### A few notes about the project
My main goal with this small but practical app was to expand my knowledge when it comes to promises, ```async``` functions and the ```await``` keyword in JavaScript. I've also practiced a lot of destructuring values from API's data. Feel free to clone this repo and get your hands dirty with the code. And of course, if you have any questions, I'm here for you! :smiley:
